					<strong>configuration</strong>
					The first thing anyone wants to do is index a web site. The configuration is split into separate files, of course they 
					can be in one file, it is just easier to have the database configuration separate from the internet configuration, as 
					follows:
					<br><br>
					1) spring.xml - contains includes of the other configuration files<br>
					2) spring-beans.xml - application beans, i.e. not really for clients to modify<br>
					3) spring-jdbc.xml - for datasources that need to be indexed, for clients<br>
					4) spring-client.xml - this is the interesting one at the moment, for clients<br><br>
					
					There is a minimal configuration set in the project, this can be found in the  
					<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ikube/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmodules%2Fcore%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fresources%2FMETA-INF%2Fminimal"
						target="_top">minimal</a> 
					folder. This folder contains the base beans for the application and one client configuration file, the only file that is 
					interesting to start with. In the spring-client.xml there is an index defined and a url to index. As it turns out it is the 
					Ikokoon site, mine. 46 pages in various languages, perfect for a first exercise.<br><br>
					
					Get the files in this minimal configuration folder and copy the files to your Tomcat ${TOMCAT_INSTALL}/bin/ikube directory. 
					Download the war and pop it in the webapps directory. 
					
					The application will look for the spring.xml file in the working directory under 'ikube', i.e. where the Jvm 
					was started. In the case of a Tomcat that will be in the 'bin/ikube' directory, where the startup.bat is.<br><br> 
					
					Failing this it will use the default configuration which is in the war, in the libs folder, in the ikube-code-${version}.jar. Of 
					course this is not where it is, it is still in the META-INF directory, along with the other configuration files. This it generally 
					what you don't want as there are databases that are not online and all sorts of things will go wrong, i fact I don't think 
					Ikube will start, i.e. undefined results. 
					<br><br>
					
					That is it. Start Tomcat. Wait for a while and the indexing will start. In a few seconds it will finish, and violla. To be able to 
					search your new index there is a fat client. Is is not complete but the search testing part is.
