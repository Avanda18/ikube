					<strong>ikube</strong>
						Ikube is an enterprise search application. It is geared to high volumes of data, and database oriented. Generally 
						for data sets that have less than 1 million records/documents other solutions are probably more effective due to the 
						overhead of configuration and the learning curve.
						<br><br>
						If you click on the language of your choice and it is still in English, this means that the translation has not been done. 
						However on the grounds that you understand this, and presumably your favorite language too, this places you in the 
						favorable position to contribute this translation, which would be much appreciated.
