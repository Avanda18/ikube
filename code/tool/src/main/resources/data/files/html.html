 coverage tools like Cobertura. There are static code analysis tools
like
            FindBugs, CheckStyle and Crap4j.
            Like any tool each needs to be studied to understand the

 of a project. Clearly. However to facilitate
            easy inspection as always the continuous integration(CI)
server is a good idea. Servers for CI are
            numerous and generally free or at least very cost effective.
 Hudson is a fine example. The continuous
            integration server is an area on the intranet where managers
 and developers can see immediately what the
            code metrics are and where to improve. They can evaluate
each others code serving as code review as well.

 coverage tools like Cobertura. There are static code analysis tools
like
            FindBugs, CheckStyle and Crap4j.

server is a good idea. Servers for CI are

 Hudson is a fine example. The continuous

 and developers can see immediately what the
            code metrics are and where to improve. They can evaluate
each others code serving as code review as well.

            tools like Serenity. Dependency tools like JDepend, and code
 coverage tools like Cobertura. There are static code analysis tools
like
            FindBugs, CheckStyle and Crap4j.
            Like any tool each needs to be studied to understand the
statistics that are generated by the tools. And of
            course this is exactly what your job is if you are a manager
 of a project. Clearly. However to facilitate
            easy inspection as always the continuous integration(CI)
server is a good idea. Servers for CI are
            numerous and generally free or at least very cost effective.
 Hudson is a fine example. The continuous
            integration server is an area on the intranet where managers
 and developers can see immediately what the
            code metrics are and where to improve. They can evaluate
each others code serving as code review as well.

 coverage tools like Cobertura. There are static code analysis tools
like
            FindBugs, CheckStyle and Crap4j.
            Like any tool each needs to be studied to understand the
statistics that are generated by the tools. And of
            course this is exactly what your job is if you are a manager
 of a project. Clearly. However to facilitate
            easy inspection as always the continuous integration(CI)
server is a good idea. Servers for CI are
            numerous and generally free or at least very cost effective.
 Hudson is a fine example. The continuous
            integration server is an area on the intranet where managers
 and developers can see immediately what the
            code metrics are and where to improve. They can evaluate
each others code serving as code review as well.
