			Hello, and thank you for the interest in Ikube!
			Documentation for Ikube is embedded in the application. This documentation is indexed(by Ikube of course, at 
			startup of Ikube in the Tomcat). There could be an instance running on CloudBees, but because Ikube is quite 
			greedy for memory, so this may not always be possible.
			The documentation is in Spring SVN/Tiles/Jsp files and has to have the server running 
			to view it properly, just makes life easier for me in fact.<br><br>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="td-content">
			In the mean time please feel free to download Ikube, pop it in your server and go to http://localhost/ikube, 
			where the UI starts. I will also be hosting database searches for companies, free of course(provided the data size 
			is less than 100 000 000), so there will be no need to run Ikube locally, just send me the details of your database, 
			and the index will be ready, well when it is ready I guess. Generally an hour per 100 000 000 records, although 
			over the net this will be reliant on the network speed and the data volume.<br><br>
