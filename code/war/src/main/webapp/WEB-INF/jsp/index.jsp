			Hello, and thank you for the interest in Ikube!
			Documentation for Ikube is embedded in the application. This documentation is indexed(by Ikube of course, at 
			startup of Ikube in the Tomcat). Within a couple of weeks there will be an instance of Ikube running on a server 
			continuously with the default and test configurations. As soon as this is available then the documentation will be 
			available online as it were. The documentation is in Spring SVN/Tiles/Jsp files and has to have the server running 
			to view it properly, just makes life easier for me in fact.

		<td class="td-content">
			As well as this there will be a searchable index(s), also available on this server. I just need to get Telenet to put 
			my IP online, you would think that this is something every ISP can do right? Wrong. Seems they don't even know 
			their own network. Lovely, but I will be changing ISPs soon in any case, and the target ISP will almost undoubtedly  
			be amenable to this request. At which point the development server goes live with Ikube and Jenkins running 
			continuously.

		<td class="td-content">
			In the mean time please feel free to download Ikube, pop it in your server and go to http://localhost:9000/ikube, 
			where the UI starts. I will also be hosting database searches for companies, free of course(provided the data size 
			is less than 100 000 000), so there will be no need to run Ikube locally, just send me the details of your database, 
			and the index will be ready, well when it is ready I guess. Generally an hour per 100 000 000 records, although 
			over the net this will be reliant on the network speed and the data volume.
