				Having arrived here you have probably read the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ikube/" target="_top">Ikube Wiki</a> introduction 
				on Google Code, so no real introduction is necessary here, so to brass tacks as it were.
				<br><br>
				If you click on the language of your choice and it is still in English, this means that the translation has not been done. 
				However on the grounds that you understand this, and presumably your favorite language too, this places you in the 
				favorable position to contribute this translation, which would be much appreciated.

				Just a little extra general information then. Ikube is Lucene based, so ultimately it is just a container for Lucene indexes. Having 
				said that it is also a clusterable application designed for very large volumes. There is no internal database setup and there are no complicated 
				transaction handling mechanisms, performance is a primary concern and with volumes of data exceeding the billion mark and likely to 
				increase by a factor every year performance is paramount.

				Please try the quick start page and move on to more complex index configurations when that is all up and running. Feel 
				free to mail me if you have any difficulty with the configuration, or if my writing style is not clear or with any suggestions 
				at michael dot couck at gmail dot com.
				<br><br>
				The individual documents for configuring and using the system are at the top of the page, 'quick start', 'configuration' etc.
