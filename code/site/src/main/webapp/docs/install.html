<p>Ikube is available for download in the <a href="http://ikube.be/artifactory">Artifactory</a>. As a web application ikube is
available as a war file that can be installed on any Java server, Tomcat, FireFly, etc. As well as the war application
file is a directory of configuration files. These files contain the core configuration of ikube, and optionally the
indexes and jobs that are defined by the user. Please navigate to the <a href="http://ikube.be/artifactory/webapp/browserepo.html?2">Artifacts</a>
tab in the <a href="http://ikube.be/artifactory">Artifactory</a>, then expand libs-releases-local, the ikube, then ikube-war, and select the
latest release. Alternatively you can get the latest snapshot release in the libs-snapshot-local repository. Click on the
version of the war, then in the right panel click the download button.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly the base configuration is in the ikube-libs folder. Again download the latest jar(Java zip file). For this installation
we wil user a <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi">Tomcat</a> server. Please download a Tomcat zip and unpack it to a convenient
place on your computer, could all be in the Downloads folder.</p>

<h4 id="_install">Install</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rename the ikube-war-xxx-xxx.war to ikube.war, it will make the web access easier, but not essential. Create
a folder in the $TOMCAT_UNPACKED_FOLDER/bin called ikube. The directory structure is important for now. Unpack the
ikube-libs-xxx-xxx.jar using WinRar or unzip feature, into the $TOMCAT_UNPACKED_FOLDER/bin/ikube folder.</p>

<h4 id="_configure">Configure</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your ip address is something other than 192.168.1.x please change the interface for the grid. We&#8217;ll get into the grid
mechanism in a later document. In the folder $TOMCAT_UNPACKED_FOLDER/bin/ikube/common open a file called spring.properties. Go
to the bottom of the file and find the property called hz-tcp-ip-interface, change the value to your ip address. For you operating
system you can use ifconfig or ipconfig to find your ip address, from the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Go to the $TOMCAT_UNPACKED_FOLDER/bin folder and execute either the startup.sh or startup.bat depending on your operating system. Note
that you may need to change the permissions of the scripts on Linux to make them executable but issuing the command &#8658; chmod 777 -R * in
the Tomcat root directory, i.e. $TOMCAT_UNPACKED_FOLDER.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Go to the <a href="http://localhost:8080/ikube/login.html">Administration Console</a>. The login credentials are user/user
