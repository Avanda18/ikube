					<string>Ikokoon ikokoon imagine, company home about software reviews contact technology reviews 11/09/2011 JSF Well it seems ok really,
						nothing to get all excited about, no silver bullet to solve all your problems. The pages written are full of JavaScript. Being a
						purest I am not completely against JavaScript, but I like to keep it to a minimum, and certainly try to keep the logic away from the
						UI. Splitting the logic between the server and the front end is going to be a maintenance nightmare. Debugging, well I have not run
						into any problems as yet so I couldn&apos;t really say for sure but I would imagine that debugging the JavaScript is going to be a
						little messy. Spring MVC Well this one seems more mature than JSF in fact, although it isn&apos;t of course. But it seems more like
						something that I would use, and this is the case because as it turns out this site is done with Spring MVC and Tiles. Firstly I like
						the fact that you don&apos;t have all the JavaScript all over the pages, pure HTML. Als</string>

					<string>Ikokoon ikokoon imagine, company home about software reviews contact optimising productivity 11/09/2011 What determines
						productivity, and how is it measured? What tools are there to increase productivity and reduce development costs? Will code coverage,
						complexity and dependency management save time and money? Each company will determine productivity in a different way, income per
						developer, dare we say lines of code, and for internal development this gets rather more difficult. So productivity really needs to be
						determined with the backdrop of the environment in view. Preferably by knowledgeable persons that can understand the relationships
						between code metrics and financial dynamics of products. The costs associated with development are 20% for initial development and 80%
						for maintenance over a 5 year period, assuming that the average application has a life span of 5 years. If development is accelerated
