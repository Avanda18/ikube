* UI - client front end for search and monitoring - 3 1/2 (Michael)
   Logging on a topic for the gui to collect for the whole cluster is an idea
   2) Administration to start an in index - 4 hours
   3) Monitoring page to see what the servers are doing - 1
   1) Search page for the documentation *
   4) Search page to search the individual indexes - 1 *
* Re-factor common code to tools module - 1
* Documentation - 6 hours
  3) On Wiki Pedia - 2 hours
  4) On various Java sites - 4 hours
  2) Migrate the documentation from docs to the application - 4 hours *
  1) On the Google code site - 2 hours * 
* Back up action - 4 hours

Sub Total: 3 1/2

* Implementation of updating the index with deltas from the client - 3
* Move the datasource to a central location for the table indexables - 4 hours
* Add strategies for indexing large files like zips - 3
* Test writing the index across the network, and reading, perhaps a stress test too - 1
* Add a shutdown that closes everything when the application is being un-deployed 
   so the new application starts the application context cleanly - 3

In progress:
* UI
* Implement distance sorting, i.e. given the co-ordinates of the originator and the co-ordinates
   of the results sort them from the closest to the furthest from the orginator - 3 (Michael)

Total: +-18

Done:
* Cluster - 3 *
* Finish the clustering support - 3 *
* Implement the synchronization between the servers - 1 *
* Add the other parsers - 3 *
* Performance - 1 *
* Large volumes - 1 *
* Add the file and url visitors - 5 *
* Multiple data sources - 1 *
* Testing - 7 *
* Cluster testing - 1 *
* Wiki/documentation/JavaDoc - 3 *
* Data generator two with files - 1/2 *
* Reconfigure the field names for the monitoring - 4 hours (Michael) *
* Rules engine for the decision - 3 (Michael) *
* New data structure, perhaps patients in a hospital - 1 *
* Create automated integration tests in different environments - 3 *
* Add the possibility for persistence in JPA - 1 *
* Stress and load test the web service - 1 *

Other things:
* Add a database tester to re-connect if the database becomes disconnected - 4 hours
* Add changes in the data to results? i.e. save the previous data and in the results - 3
   offer a series of documents representing how they changed over the 
   indexes/periods, i.e. shallow deltas.
* Add a shutdown hook for the Spring objects that need to be closed when the context - 3
  gets refreshed. This can aid in the dynamic configuration.
* Security - 3
* Stemming - 2
* Taxonomy - 3
* Spelling checking, done just need to migrate the code from the old project. - 1
* Phonetic search - 3
* Result clustering - 3
* Reporting (e.g. Google Analytics) - 1
* Add a maximum documents per server parameter - 1
* Performance benchmarking - 3

Done:
* Delete the database file on startup locally *
* Add a reporting module that checks the database connection, the indexes in the different contexts and sends
   the result to a mail address. Perhaps some profiling information, etc. *
* Add a configuration for a file system *
* Add a configuration for a mail account *
* Test the parsers *
* Add sorting to the multi and single searchers *
* Is there automatically language support, i.e. are languages handled transparently? Chinese,
   Russian, other scripting languages? It seems that way in fact. Certainly Russsian and Arabic 
   are handled by Lucene automatically. (Michael)

Won't Do:
* Boosting
* Servlet/Ejb - 1?
* Add slave to run on the client machine and transfer data to the master running 
   on our servers as a hosting service.
* Add possibility to have index in memory so as not to write on the file system - 3
* Add facets to the search possibilities - 5
