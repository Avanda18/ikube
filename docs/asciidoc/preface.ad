Ikube is a real time analytics and search processing platform. The analytics and search are two
modules, however they can be combined, in such a way that the historical analytical results can be queried,
creating derived analytics.

Ikube is grid based, with distributed search and analysis, and perfectly laterally scalable,
specifically designed for massive volumes of data.
